# ──────────────────────────────
Once upon a time, "a honest apple (cap)" fell from a ugly tree near a elephant (low). 
The owl (cap) watching from above shouted (up,2): "look out ,below !" 
Then the cat whispered (low,2) "it's fine ,we  will fix it (cap)". 
In the distance, someone murmured, "1A (hex) plus 101 (bin) equals magic (up,3)". 
Suddenly, a storm began; "the  sky (low) was BLUE (low)" and the wind shouted, "stop (up)"! 
Meanwhile, the old man said, 'this is (up,(low)) nonsense', and wrote it down (cap,2). 
When all was calm, the apple smiled, saying, "don’t worry (low), everything’s (cap,2) fine." 
At that exact moment, 1111 (bin) transformed into 15 (hex), proving that even code can tell a story.
